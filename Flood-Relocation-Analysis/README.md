# 🌊 Flood Relocation & Terrain Suitability Analysis – Valmeyer, IL

## Problem Statement

Severe flooding led to the physical relocation of the town of Valmeyer, IL. This analysis evaluates terrain suitability and spatial accessibility to understand how GIS can support land-use planning and infrastructure decisions in post-disaster relocation scenarios.

## Project Objective

Evaluate terrain suitability and relocation feasibility for a flood-impacted community using spatial analysis and raster modeling.

## Data Sources

USGS 10m Digital Elevation Model (DEM)

Municipal parcel boundary datasets

Road network shapefiles

Historical flood zone data

## Tools Used

ArcGIS Pro • Spatial Analyst • Zonal Statistics • Raster Distance • ArcGIS Online

## Spatial Analysis Workflow

Derived slope and elevation rasters from DEM

Conducted zonal statistics to evaluate terrain conditions

Calculated mean relocation distances using raster distance tools

Integrated parcel and infrastructure data to assess accessibility

Developed comparative maps of original vs relocated parcels

## Key Findings

Identified steep-slope and elevation-constrained areas unsuitable for redevelopment

Highlighted zones with favorable terrain and transportation access for future land use

Demonstrated how GIS-based terrain analysis supports evidence-based relocation and planning decisions
